# Car_Price_Regression_Analysis_Machine-Learning
### Problem Description
A Chinese automobile company aims to enter the US market by establishing a local manufacturing unit to compete with American and European brands. To strategize effectively, the company has partnered with an automobile consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing car pricing in the US market. This includes identifying significant variables affecting prices and determining how these variables explain pricing dynamics.

The consulting firm has gathered a comprehensive dataset from market surveys to assist with this analysis.

### Objective
To build a predictive model for car prices in the US market by:

Identifying significant factors influencing car prices.
Explaining how these factors impact pricing.
Providing actionable insights for car design, manufacturing, and pricing strategies.
This model will enable the company to optimize their product offerings and remain competitive in the US automotive market.

### Data Description
### Source:
The dataset was curated by an automobile consulting firm based on extensive market surveys in the US automotive industry.
